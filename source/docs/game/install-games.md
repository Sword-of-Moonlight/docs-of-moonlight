Installing games created with SoM is a painless experience for the most part - the editor itself creates portable runtimes, so they don't rely on any specific directory to function and they can be safely installed to portable storage devices. Despite what you may have heard, **you do not have to install the SoM Editor to run games made with SoM**. They are fully self contained and can be distributed without the burden of the editor weighing them down.

## Prerequisites
1. A Windows machine, a compatibility layer A.K.A Wine, or a VM with Windows...
2. A file un/archiver. We recommend you use [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
3. The game (duh, silly)

## Steps
_Most_ of the games we host here at *.swordofmoonlight.com come packaged as zip files you simply need to extract, and this guide will assume that this is the case for the game you have. Some games are known to come as installers, but we don't support those for security reasons and overall pointlessness in function (remember, SoM games are portable by nature).

### Windows 11+
1. Right click on the archive, 'Show More Options' -> '7-Zip' -> 'Extract To "<game name>\"' and wait for 7-Zip window to close.
2. Open up the created folder (it should match what was in the quotations next to "Extract To"), navigate through the directory tree until you find two folders named "PARAM" and "DATA."
3. If you want to move the game to somewhere else, now is the best time to do that. Simply cut all the files from where you extracted them and paste them to the location you want.
4. To play, launch the executable that is next to the "PARAM" and "DATA" folders.

### Windows XP To 10
1. Right click on the archive, '7-Zip' -> 'Extract To "<game name>\"' and wait for 7-Zip window to close.
2. Open up the created folder (it should match what was in the quotations next to "Extract To"), navigate through the directory tree until you find two folders named "PARAM" and "DATA."
3. If you want to move the game to somewhere else, now is the best time to do that. Simply cut all the files from where you extracted them and paste them to the location you want.
4. To play, launch the executable that is next to the "PARAM" and "DATA" folders.

Now... That's it. No, really - you're all done, though you may still want to check out the [Compatibility Fixes](comp-games.md) and [Known Bugs](bugs-games.md) pages.
