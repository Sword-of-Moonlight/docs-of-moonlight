Welcome to the Sword of Moonlight Compendium, your one stop shop for 'Sword of Moonlight: The King's Field Making Tool' documentation!

# BIG FAT WARNING - WORK IN PROGRESS.

### Seek Guidance
Thanks to our chosen documentation generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), we have the ability to offer you a search function to use if you're looking for something specific. Familiarize yourself with the large 'Search' box in the top right of the screen.

If you've searched and still can't find the answers to your questions, you can reach other community members through our [Forum](https://forum.swordofmoonlight.com) or the [Sword of Moonlight Discord Server](https://discord.gg/66CQdB738d).

### For Our Night Owls
Scan your eyes to the left of the search bar, and you'll be presented with a switch for toggling between light mode and dark mode.

### Would You Like a Menu?
If you're browsing this documentation on a portable computation device, you can locate the hamburger menu at the top of the screen and to the far left. Otherwise, you'll find a list of the compendiums content to your left at all times (*on supported displays*.)
