# Welcome to the Sword of Moonlight Compendium Project!
Welcome to the Sword of Moonlight Compendium, your one stop shop for 'Sword of Moonlight: The King's Field Making Tool' documentation!

If you've found yourself here because you're looking to play a game that was made with SoM, we've got you covered [here](game/install-games.md), if you're instead here because you want to try your hand at making a game with SoM yourself - read on!

### Seek Guidance

If you've searched and still can't find the answers to your questions, you can reach out to other community members through our [Forum](https://forum.swordofmoonlight.com) or the [Sword of Moonlight Discord Server](https://discord.gg/66CQdB738d).
