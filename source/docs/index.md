# Welcome to the Sword of Moonlight Compendium Project!
Welcome to the Sword of Moonlight Compendium, your one stop shop for 'Sword of Moonlight: The King's Field Making Tool' documentation!

If you've found yourself here because you're looking to play a game that was made with SoM, we've got you covered [here](game/install-games.md), if you're instead here because you want to try your hand at making a game with SoM yourself - read on!

# Legacy Documentation
While no longer updated, the legacy documentation is still more complete than this new effort - and so it is avaliable [here](https://doc.swordofmoonlight.com/old/).

### Seek Guidance
Thanks to our chosen documentation generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), we have the ability to offer you a search function to use if you're looking for something specific. Familiarize yourself with the large 'Search' box (or magnifying glass) at the top right of the screen.

If you've searched and still can't find the answers to your questions, you can reach out to other community members through our [Forum](https://forum.swordofmoonlight.com) or the [Sword of Moonlight Discord Server](https://discord.gg/66CQdB738d).

### For Our Night Owls
Scan your eyes to the left of the search bar, and you'll be presented with a switch for toggling between light mode and dark mode.

### Hello Phone User, Would You Like a Menu?
