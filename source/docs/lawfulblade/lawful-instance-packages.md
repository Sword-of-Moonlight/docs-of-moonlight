# Lawful Blade - Managing Instance Packages
Packages are the main point of Lawful Blade - a package is a collection of files and modifications to an editor instance, which can be installed in order to provide adjustments or fixes to the instance.

### How do?..
On each instance in the instance tab, is a button array to the bottom right of the instance - the button with an arrow pointing into a cardboard box will allow you to modify the packages installed onto an instance. Pressing the button will open up a package list, and you can pick and choose which packages you would like to install to the instance.

Packages are _per_ instance, so you won't break another instance if you choose a different set of packages - and furthermore, packages you install to one instance will need to be installed again if you create a new instance.
